description: "`lima` is a program to convert Literate Haskell files in the
             birdtick format to correctly rendered (git flavoured, html containing) markdown files 
             and vice versa.
             .  type:                exitcode-stdio-1.0
             It strips away the heading tags #, replacing them with the corresponding html tags,
             converts the `'''haskell [...]'''` to `> [...]` as recognised by the GHC literate prepocessor.
             `''' [...] '''` will be converted to `< [...]` and will be discarded by ghc but will still be displayed as code when rendered. 
             (In both cases `'''` is actually the three md backticks, but its a pain to write md about md.)
             .
             Usage:
             .
             `lima (toLhs|toMd) file1 [file2] [...]`;
             The `toLhs` and `toMd` commands are not case sensitive. 
             The program will convert each file from the other format to the specified one, 
             creating the files `file1.md` `file2.md` ... or `file1.lhs` `file2.lhs` ... in the same directory respectively."
